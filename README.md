# My-DSA-Mastery-Journey
🚀 My DSA Mastery Journey
"Code with purpose, solve with passion" 🌟

🛠 Why This Repository Exists
This repo documents my systematic preparation for technical placements, focusing on:
Core Java fundamentals (from basics to advanced)
Daily DSA problem-solving on GeeksforGeeks (GFG) and LeetCode
Algorithmic thinking development
Consistent progress tracking

📚 My Learning Path
Phase 1: Core Java Mastery
Basics:
Data types, loops, conditionals
Functions/methods, arrays, strings
Object-oriented programming (OOP) principles

Phase 2: DSA Deep Dive
Data Structures:
Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
Trees, graphs, heaps, hash tables

Algorithms:
Sorting/searching, recursion, dynamic programming
Greedy algorithms, backtracking, BFS/DFS

🧩 Daily Practice Framework
My Problem-Solving Ritual
Morning:
Review 1 DSA concept (Youtube Apna College)
Solve 1 easy problem (warm-up)
Afternoon:
Tackle 2-3 medium/hard problems
Focus on time/space optimization
Evening:
Code review and refactoring
Analyze edge cases and test cases

My Approach
First Attempt: Solve without hints
Second Attempt: Optimize solution
Third Attempt: Compare with editorial
Daily Reflection: Document learnings

Leetcode : https://leetcode.com/u/SHAIK_MASTAN/

🎯 My DSA Strategy
Understand: Problem constraints and requirements
Brainstorm: Multiple approaches (greedy, DP, BFS/DFS)
Implement: Clean Java code with comments
Verify: Edge cases + custom test cases
Reflect: Optimize and compare with solutions

🛠 Tools & Setup
IDE: VS Code
Version Control: Git/GitHub
Testing: JUnit + Mockito
Debugging: VisualVM + Eclipse MAT
