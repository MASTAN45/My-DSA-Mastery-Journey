# My-DSA-Mastery-Journey
This repository documents my structured journey to mastering Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) in Java for technical placements. It includes daily practice problems from (GFG) and LeetCode, along with problem-solving strategies. The goal is to develop algorithmic intuition, improve coding skills, and prepare effectively for technical interviews.
